<p>What CFOA is unable to do is to respond to requests for information under the Act. The organisation is too small and there are too few members of staff to be able to conduct the necessary research and to compile the responses. Accordingly, CFOA is adopting a policy of responding to requests for information only if it is readily available and can be swiftly transmitted to the inquirer. Other requests for information will be politely refused.</p>
<p>Members of the public who are considering making a request for information from a fire and rescue service should contact that service.""</p> </blockquote>",2011-12-17 13:45:38 +0000,2013-09-24 14:59:54 +0100,4

SCHT was joined in 2002 by Shape Housing Association (formerly Bath Self Help), a specialist provider of supported housing with around 150 bed spaces.
